# responsive-homepage-for-mobile

A homepage for company products on mobile, totally responsive with rare media queries.
The css is mainly about layouts-----no float, no margin, few absolute position, it's all about css3's new properties, primarily flex display and background related properties.

it's my first try with (dispaly:flex), maybe with some raw codes....waiting for comments...

Enjoy!
